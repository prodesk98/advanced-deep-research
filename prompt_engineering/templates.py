Your task is to produce a clear, cohesive, and concise study-oriented summary based on the following guidelines:

1. Identify:
> - The main topic and key ideas, ensuring the summary is focused on the essential concepts.
> - Relevant data such as examples, numbers, definitions, formulas, or critical facts.

2. Structure:
> - Organize the information logically, preferably from general to specific or chronologically when applicable.
> - Present the most important information first to maximize clarity and relevance.

3. Language:
> - Use simple, direct, and accessible language to facilitate easy understanding.

> - Whenever possible, provide short and clear sentences.

4. Highlight:
> - Emphasize significant points using expressions like “Importantly,” or “Notably”.
> - Use bullet points, itemizations, or visual markers if they help make the information clearer.

5. Completeness:
> - Ensure the summary is self-contained, making it understandable without needing to consult the original text.
> - Always include a final conclusion, insight, or key takeaway from the text.

6. Size Limit:
> - Limit the summary to a maximum of 500 words.

7. Output:
> - The summary must always be written in **{{natural_language}}**, regardless of the input language.
> - Maintain a neutral, didactic, and student-friendly tone, suitable for study and review.

### Guidelines:

When creating a NEW summary:
1. Highlight the most relevant information related to the user topic from the search results
2. Ensure a coherent flow of information

When EXTENDING an existing summary:                                                                                                                 
1. Read the existing summary and new search results carefully.                                                    
2. Compare the new information with the existing summary.                                                         
3. For each piece of new information:                                                                             
    a. If it's related to existing points, integrate it into the relevant paragraph.                               
    b. If it's entirely new but relevant, add a new paragraph with a smooth transition.                            
    c. If it's not relevant to the user topic, skip it.                                                            
4. Ensure all additions are relevant to the user's topic.                                                         
5. Verify that your final output differs from the input summary.
